	<p align="justify">European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the late 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885.[5][6]: 123  The period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.[6]: 167 

During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[6]: 195–197  The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947

<p align="justify">The true heroes of India are the freedom fighters. The freedom we possess was not always possible. Behind this liberation is the battle of our freedom fighters, who sacrificed their own lives for India, their motherland, without regard for their own safety. Behind the 15th of August, 1947, Independence Day celebration, there is a violent and chaotic history of horrible uprisings, battles, and movements led by tens of thousands of brave and patriotic Indian independence fighters who fought alongside the British for India’s independence.

To free India from British rule, every one of India’s freedom warriors fought, toiled, and frequently gave their lives. To end the rule of foreign imperialists and their Colonialism in India, a sizable group of revolutionaries and activists from various racial and ethnic backgrounds got together.

Their achievements, which vary from armed revolution to nonviolent resistance, all contributed significantly to India’s eventual conquest of freedom. Numerous additional patriots, both well-known and unknown, sacrificed their life for the nation’s liberty alongside these legendary personalities. Their combined efforts and sacrifices are still remembered today and serve as a symbol of the unyielding spirit that guided India towards independence.
